            <ol>
                <li>Step 1
                <p>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p></li>
                <li>Step 2 
                    <p>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush the skin-side of each piece with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</p></li>
                <li>Step 3 
                    <p>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and sprinkle half the seasoning mixture evenly over the 4 chicken thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle remaining seasoning mixture on top. Place chicken thighs in the air fryer basket in a single layer, skin-side up.</p></li>
                <li>Step 4
                    <p>Fry in the preheated air fryer until chicken is brown and juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p></li>
